# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-29)

**Core value:** Self-hosted Myrlin server fully supports mobile clients with persistent auth, device management, push notifications, and optimized data sync.
**Current focus:** Phase 11: SSE and Sync Optimization

## Current Position

Phase: 11 of 13 (SSE and Sync Optimization)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase (COMPLETE)
Status: In Progress
Last activity: 2026-03-29 - Completed Plan 11-01 (SSE heartbeat and device-aware client registry)

Progress: [███████░░░] 73% (27/37 plans)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (from v1.0):**
- Total plans completed: 23
- Average duration: 4.7m
- Total execution time: ~1.8 hours

**v1.1 metrics:**

| Phase | Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|-------|------|----------|-------|-------|
| 08    | 01   | 3min     | 2     | 4     |
| Phase 08 P02 | 2min | 2 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 08 P03 | 4min | 2 tasks | 2 files |
| 11    | 01   | 3min     | 1     | 1     |
| Phase 09 P01 | 2min | 2 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 10 P01 | 2min | 2 tasks | 1 files |
| 12    | 01   | 3min     | 2     | 2     |
| Phase 10 P02 | 3min | 2 tasks | 1 files |
| Phase 12 P02 | 3min | 2 tasks | 4 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v1.1 Roadmap: 6 phases (8-13), standard granularity, derived from design doc phases A-F
- v1.1 Roadmap: Phase 8 is critical path; Phases 9, 10, 11, 12 can run in parallel after Phase 8
- v1.1 Roadmap: Testing requirements distributed across phases (each phase tests its own work)
- v1.1 Roadmap: Token refresh (TOKN-05/06) placed in Phase 12 (API Enhancement) not Phase 8 (avoids scope creep on critical path)
- v1.1 Roadmap: ERRR requirements isolated in Phase 13 (applies uniformly to all endpoints after they exist)

- 08-01: Device tokens stored plaintext (matches pushDevices pattern; hashing deferred to Phase 12)
- 08-01: CORS preflight allows Authorization from any origin (OPTIONS cannot carry Bearer)
- 08-01: lastSeenAt debounced at 60s per device
- [Phase 08]: SSE clients migrated from Set to Map for device online detection
- [Phase 08]: Test push sends to single device via Expo API, not broadcast
- [Phase 08]: Module-level reload pattern for testing restart survival (faster than full server restart)

- 11-01: SSE heartbeat uses comment syntax (`: heartbeat`) not data events, avoids triggering onmessage
- 11-01: All SSE timers call .unref() so Node process exits cleanly
- 11-01: GLOBAL_EVENT_TYPES kept module-scoped (not exported), Plan 11-02 uses it in same file
- [Phase 09]: Tailscale detection uses 100.x.x.x prefix match; primary URL order: custom > tunnel > lan > local
- [Phase 10]: 10-01: Per-device retry (not batch POST) so one stale token does not block others
- [Phase 10]: 10-01: Module-level Map + setTimeout for 2-second push batching window
- 12-01: Dual-mode endpoint detection (mode param = legacy, pagination params = new response shape)
- 12-01: Default no-params returns legacy { sessions } for backward compat with existing GUI
- [Phase 10]: shouldNotify defaults to true for unknown event types and missing preferences (fail-open)
- [Phase 12]: Scrollback joins buffer chunks then splits by newline for accurate line counting
- [Phase 12]: Token refresh only for device tokens (403 for browser tokens) as security boundary

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 and Phase 7 from v1.0 show as in-progress in prior state (may need completion before v1.1 starts)
