## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 7 phases (standard granularity), consolidated from research-suggested 9
- Roadmap: Phases 4, 5, 6 are parallel-safe (all depend on Phase 3, not each other)
- Roadmap: Server endpoints (SRVR) split across Phase 2 (pairing) and Phase 6 (push)
- 01-01: Used Expo SDK 55 (latest canary) instead of SDK 54
- 01-01: MMKV v4 uses createMMKV() factory, not new MMKV() constructor
- 01-01: Reanimated plugin auto-detected by SDK 55, removed from explicit plugins
- 01-02: Plus Jakarta Sans loaded via direct TTF require paths from @expo-google-fonts package
- 01-02: Tab screens use subdirectory structure for future nested stack routes
- 01-02: Ionicons for tab bar icons (ships with Expo, good coverage)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Used com.myrlin.mobile as Maestro appId matching Expo slug convention
- 02-01: Shared rate limiter between login and pairing endpoints (single IP budget)
- 02-01: Dependency injection for pairing routes (setupPairing receives auth functions as params)
- 02-01: SecureStore adapter is async, Zustand persist handles it natively
- 02-01: API client pair() omits Authorization header since pairing is pre-auth
- [Phase 02]: MMKV for biometric preference (non-sensitive, sync reads)
- [Phase 02]: Health polling: 5s base, doubles to 60s max, recursive setTimeout for backoff
- [Phase 02]: Disconnect is best-effort server-side, always clears local state
- 02-02: Conditional Stack rendering for auth gate (not Redirect component)
- 02-02: Hydration gate prevents flash-to-onboarding for returning users
- 02-02: expo-camera CameraView with barcodeScannerSettings for QR scanning
- 02-02: QR scan cooldown (1.5s) prevents multiple fires on same code
- 03-01: QueryClientProvider added to root _layout.tsx (was missing, required for TanStack Query)
- 03-01: SSE events invalidate TanStack Query cache only, never mutate state directly
- 03-01: SessionCard uses Pressable directly (Card component lacks onLongPress)
- 03-01: FlashList v2 without estimatedItemSize (auto-measures per research)
- 03-04: useDebounce inline helper (no external dependency for simple 10-line utility)
- 03-04: FlatList in QuickSwitcher (small list inside modal, FlashList unnecessary)
- 03-04: Conflict polling at 30s via refetchInterval (no SSE event for conflicts)
- [Phase 03]: Move up/down buttons for workspace reorder instead of drag-to-reorder
- [Phase 03]: 14-swatch Catppuccin palette grid shared between workspace actions and create modal
- [Phase 03]: Stack _layout.tsx added per tab directory for nested Expo Router navigation
- [Phase 03]: Bulk stop uses Promise.allSettled for parallel execution with success/failure counting
- 04-01: Build script inlines xterm.js (~492KB) into terminal.html to avoid CDN dependency
- 04-01: WebSocket inside WebView (not bridged through RN) for PTY data performance
- 04-01: Asset.fromModule for reliable HTML asset loading across iOS/Android
- 04-01: Bridge callbacks in refs to prevent stale closures in WebView onMessage
- [Phase 04-terminal]: Two-step pendingTextAction ref pattern for async bridge copy/share
- [Phase 04-terminal]: KeyboardProvider wraps TerminalScreen locally (not app root) to isolate changes
- 04-03: react-native-pager-view for native carousel swipe physics (not ScrollView horizontal)
- 04-03: Lazy WebView mounting via isActive prop, only active carousel page renders xterm.js
- 04-03: Reader mode overlay uses getScrollback bridge message, keeps WebSocket alive underneath
- [Phase 05]: FlashList scrollEnabled=false inside ScrollView for nested scroll in resource monitor
- [Phase 05-data-screens]: Victory Native v2 API (CartesianChart + Line), not legacy v1
- [Phase 05-data-screens]: 30s staleTime for cost queries (heavier data than sessions)
- 05-02: ActionSheet for kanban status changes instead of drag-drop (reliability over animation)
- 05-02: LayoutAnimation for doc section collapse (simpler than Reanimated layout transitions)
- 05-02: Inline TextInput for adding doc items (faster UX than modal)
- 05-03: ActionSheet "Move to" for task status changes (reanimated-dnd not available, per plan fallback)
- 05-03: Auto-generated branch names from task description with feat/ prefix
- 05-03: FlatList per kanban column (small dataset per column, FlashList unnecessary)
- [Phase 06]: Used Node.js built-in fetch for Expo Push API (Node 18+ requirement)
- [Phase 06]: Status cache Map in push listener to detect session state transitions
- [Phase 06]: store.state getter (not getState method) per existing store API convention
- [Phase 06]: expo-notifications SDK 55 requires shouldShowBanner/shouldShowList in notification handler
- [Phase 06]: Global toast is additive; existing per-screen local toasts untouched
- [Phase 06]: Push token tracked as transient state in server store, re-acquired on launch
- [Phase 06]: Inline theme picker grid (not modal) for instant live preview on tap
- [Phase 06]: expo-updates wrapped in try/catch for graceful handling in dev builds
- [Phase 06]: renameServer added to server-store as simple map-replace pattern
- [Phase 07]: Haptics gated by settings-store hapticFeedback boolean via getState()
- [Phase 07]: Deep link scheme already in app.json; Expo Router auto-resolves from file structure
- [Phase 07]: MMKV offline queue (id: 'myrlin-offline') with module-level singleton pattern
- [Phase 07]: replayQueue takes baseUrl+token to avoid circular import with api-client
- [Phase 07]: Network errors caught at _fetch level; mutations queued, GETs rethrown for TanStack cache
- [Phase 07]: Maestro flows use optional taps for data-dependent screens
- [Phase 07]: Jest installed with --legacy-peer-deps for Expo SDK 55 canary compatibility

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flag: SSE may break in Expo dev mode (CDP interceptor bug) - test in preview builds during Phase 3
- Research flag: react-native-reanimated-dnd (MEDIUM confidence) for kanban in Phase 5 - prototype early, custom fallback ready
- Research flag: Victory Native + Reanimated 4 chart compatibility for Phase 5 - validate early
