# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-28)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 7 phases (standard granularity), consolidated from research-suggested 9
- Roadmap: Phases 4, 5, 6 are parallel-safe (all depend on Phase 3, not each other)
- Roadmap: Server endpoints (SRVR) split across Phase 2 (pairing) and Phase 6 (push)
- 01-01: Used Expo SDK 55 (latest canary) instead of SDK 54
- 01-01: MMKV v4 uses createMMKV() factory, not new MMKV() constructor
- 01-01: Reanimated plugin auto-detected by SDK 55, removed from explicit plugins
- 01-02: Plus Jakarta Sans loaded via direct TTF require paths from @expo-google-fonts package
- 01-02: Tab screens use subdirectory structure for future nested stack routes
- 01-02: Ionicons for tab bar icons (ships with Expo, good coverage)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Used com.myrlin.mobile as Maestro appId matching Expo slug convention

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flag: SSE may break in Expo dev mode (CDP interceptor bug) - test in preview builds during Phase 3
- Research flag: react-native-reanimated-dnd (MEDIUM confidence) for kanban in Phase 5 - prototype early, custom fallback ready
- Research flag: Victory Native + Reanimated 4 chart compatibility for Phase 5 - validate early
