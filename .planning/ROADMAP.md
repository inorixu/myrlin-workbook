# Roadmap: Myrlin Mobile

## Overview

Myrlin Mobile is a React Native (Expo) companion app connecting to the existing Myrlin Workbook Express backend. The roadmap moves from build pipeline and theming (Phase 1) through server connectivity (Phase 2), the core session management screens (Phase 3), terminal rendering (Phase 4), data and task screens (Phase 5), push notifications and settings (Phase 6), and finally platform polish with full test coverage (Phase 7). Each phase delivers a coherent, testable capability that builds on the previous foundation.

## Milestones

- 🚧 **v1.0 Mobile App** - Phases 1-7 (in progress)
- 📋 **v1.1 Server Mobile Support** - Phases 8-13 (planned)

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. GET /api/sessions supports limit, offset, status filter, sort, search, and workspaceId filter with total count and hasMore in the response
  2. Existing unpaginated session requests still work (backward compatible; default limit 50, max 100)
  3. Mobile can fetch the last N lines of terminal scrollback without loading the full buffer
  4. Mobile app silently refreshes its auth token before expiration so the user never has to re-pair
  5. Integration tests verify pagination with various filter combinations
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:

**Depends on**: Phase 8 (all endpoints exist to standardize)
**Requirements**: ERRR-01, ERRR-02, ERRR-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All mobile-facing error responses include a machine-readable error code (not just HTTP status) that the mobile app can switch on
  2. Rate-limited responses include a Retry-After header so mobile clients know when to retry
  3. Every API response includes X-API-Version: 1 header for future backward compatibility
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
