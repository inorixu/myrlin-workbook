## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Local terminal (run Claude on phone) | Impossible; Claude Code requires server-side execution |
| In-app code editor | Scope creep; this is a session manager, not an IDE |
| Desktop (Electron) app | Mobile-only scope; desktop already has web GUI |
| Multi-user team sync | Requires coordination server; deferred to paid tier |
| Offline terminal operation | Terminal requires active server connection |
| myrlin.io relay (v1) | Requires separate backend infrastructure; Phase 2+ |
