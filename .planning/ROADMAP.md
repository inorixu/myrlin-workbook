# Roadmap: Myrlin Mobile

## Overview

Myrlin Mobile is a React Native (Expo) companion app connecting to the existing Myrlin Workbook Express backend. The roadmap moves from build pipeline and theming (Phase 1) through server connectivity (Phase 2), the core session management screens (Phase 3), terminal rendering (Phase 4), data and task screens (Phase 5), push notifications and settings (Phase 6), and finally platform polish with full test coverage (Phase 7). Each phase delivers a coherent, testable capability that builds on the previous foundation.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.
