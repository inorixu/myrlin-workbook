# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-28)

**Core value:** A Myrlin user can monitor, control, and interact with all their Claude Code sessions from their phone with the same capability as the desktop web interface, plus native mobile advantages.
**Current focus:** Phase 2: Connection and Auth

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 7 (Connection and Auth)
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase
Status: In Progress
Last activity: 2026-03-29 - Completed 02-02 (Auth screens: onboarding, QR scan, manual connect, login)

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 57%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 6.5m
- Total execution time: 0.22 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 2/3 | 13m | 6.5m |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 7 phases (standard granularity), consolidated from research-suggested 9
- Roadmap: Phases 4, 5, 6 are parallel-safe (all depend on Phase 3, not each other)
- Roadmap: Server endpoints (SRVR) split across Phase 2 (pairing) and Phase 6 (push)
- 01-01: Used Expo SDK 55 (latest canary) instead of SDK 54
- 01-01: MMKV v4 uses createMMKV() factory, not new MMKV() constructor
- 01-01: Reanimated plugin auto-detected by SDK 55, removed from explicit plugins
- 01-02: Plus Jakarta Sans loaded via direct TTF require paths from @expo-google-fonts package
- 01-02: Tab screens use subdirectory structure for future nested stack routes
- 01-02: Ionicons for tab bar icons (ships with Expo, good coverage)
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Used com.myrlin.mobile as Maestro appId matching Expo slug convention
- 02-01: Shared rate limiter between login and pairing endpoints (single IP budget)
- 02-01: Dependency injection for pairing routes (setupPairing receives auth functions as params)
- 02-01: SecureStore adapter is async, Zustand persist handles it natively
- 02-01: API client pair() omits Authorization header since pairing is pre-auth
- [Phase 02]: MMKV for biometric preference (non-sensitive, sync reads)
- [Phase 02]: Health polling: 5s base, doubles to 60s max, recursive setTimeout for backoff
- [Phase 02]: Disconnect is best-effort server-side, always clears local state
- 02-02: Conditional Stack rendering for auth gate (not Redirect component)
- 02-02: Hydration gate prevents flash-to-onboarding for returning users
- 02-02: expo-camera CameraView with barcodeScannerSettings for QR scanning
- 02-02: QR scan cooldown (1.5s) prevents multiple fires on same code

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flag: SSE may break in Expo dev mode (CDP interceptor bug) - test in preview builds during Phase 3
- Research flag: react-native-reanimated-dnd (MEDIUM confidence) for kanban in Phase 5 - prototype early, custom fallback ready
- Research flag: Victory Native + Reanimated 4 chart compatibility for Phase 5 - validate early
