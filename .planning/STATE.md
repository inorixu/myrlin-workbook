# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-29)

**Core value:** Self-hosted Myrlin server fully supports mobile clients with persistent auth, device management, push notifications, and optimized data sync.
**Current focus:** Phase 8: Token Persistence and Device Registry

## Current Position

Phase: 8 of 13 (Token Persistence and Device Registry) - first phase of v1.1
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase (COMPLETE)
Status: Phase Complete
Last activity: 2026-03-29 - Completed Plan 08-03 (token persistence and device management tests)

Progress: [██████████] 100% (Phase 8)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (from v1.0):**
- Total plans completed: 23
- Average duration: 4.7m
- Total execution time: ~1.8 hours

**v1.1 metrics:**

| Phase | Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|-------|------|----------|-------|-------|
| 08    | 01   | 3min     | 2     | 4     |
| Phase 08 P02 | 2min | 2 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 08 P03 | 4min | 2 tasks | 2 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v1.1 Roadmap: 6 phases (8-13), standard granularity, derived from design doc phases A-F
- v1.1 Roadmap: Phase 8 is critical path; Phases 9, 10, 11, 12 can run in parallel after Phase 8
- v1.1 Roadmap: Testing requirements distributed across phases (each phase tests its own work)
- v1.1 Roadmap: Token refresh (TOKN-05/06) placed in Phase 12 (API Enhancement) not Phase 8 (avoids scope creep on critical path)
- v1.1 Roadmap: ERRR requirements isolated in Phase 13 (applies uniformly to all endpoints after they exist)

- 08-01: Device tokens stored plaintext (matches pushDevices pattern; hashing deferred to Phase 12)
- 08-01: CORS preflight allows Authorization from any origin (OPTIONS cannot carry Bearer)
- 08-01: lastSeenAt debounced at 60s per device
- [Phase 08]: SSE clients migrated from Set to Map for device online detection
- [Phase 08]: Test push sends to single device via Expo API, not broadcast
- [Phase 08]: Module-level reload pattern for testing restart survival (faster than full server restart)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 and Phase 7 from v1.0 show as in-progress in prior state (may need completion before v1.1 starts)
